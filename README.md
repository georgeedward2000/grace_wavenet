AI Music Generator using WaveNet generative model principle
I used the WaveNet generative model principle to develop my first AI Deep Learning project. The model is trained on Beethoven's piano classics, around 4 hours of data, at batch_size = 128, 50 epochs. I used python libraries: 'music21' for music processing and digital convertion, 'keras' for building and training the deep learning model and generating music, 'matplotlib' to visualise the data and 'numpy' for efficient array computing.
